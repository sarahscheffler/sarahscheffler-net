    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
    I am jointly appointed between <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">Software and Societal Systems</a> (in the School of Computer Science) and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/">Engineering and Public Policy</a> (in the
    College of Engineering).  If you are interested in joining me as a student in the Fall of 2024, please first poke around this page to see what kind of work I do, 
    and apply to either department at CMU.  (I can sometimes advise students outside of S3D or EPP; if you applied to a different department, please email me.)
    My ideal student has a strong background or interest in cryptography and its intersection with societal, legal, and policy issues.</p>

    <p>I am a studying applied cryptographer working at the intersection of computer science, policy, and law.  My
    interdisciplinary work includes policy and technical analysis of end-to-end encrypted content moderation, compelled
    decryption, and privacy-preserving computation as applied to journalism, age verification, and more.  
    I also do "pure" applied cryptography, including work
    on zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, private set intersection, and hash combiners.</p>

    <p>Formerly, I was a postdoctoral research associate at MIT's <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/">Internet Policy Research Initiative</a>,
    and before that I was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University's <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>.
    I obtained my Ph.D. from Boston University in 2021, advised by Prof. Mayank Varia.  
    During my time at BU, I was a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/busec/">BUsec</a> 
    group, I organized the  
    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/riscs/seminars-large-and-small-covering-the-security-issues-of-today/">BUsec
        Seminar</a> for security, cryptography, and privacy, as well as the Multi-Party Computation Reading Group, 
    and I was an active member of the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/hic/cyber-alliance/">Cyber Security, Law, and Society Alliance</a>.</p>

    <h2>Current Research</h2>

    <h3>Transparency and Public Verifiability for Content Moderation in End-to-End Encryption</h3>
    <p>It is possible to build systems that analyze the content of end-to-end encrypted messaging, either by observing
    the content on the client side, or by obliviously processing it on the server side.  However, these systems bring
    both technical and policy challenges for ensuring that these systems are used as advertised and without enabling
    mass surveillance or infringing on civil rights.  Technical improvements are possible for a limited number of these
    issues, and the rest must be addressed at a legal or policy level.</p>

    <h3>Enabling Journalistic, Social, and Scientific Research with Applied Privacy-Preserving Computing</h3>
    <p>The last decade has seen an explosion in cryptographic and statistical tools for privacy-preserving computation: 
    multi-party computation, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and (sort of) functional encryption.  But these
    tools remain largey confined to theoretical proposals, or, at best, unwieldy codebases with high learning curves.
    I aim to bring this privacy-preserving computation to particular users who need high levels of privacy in their analysis,
    especially journalists wishing to protect sources, researchers needing to comply with privacy protocols.
    Actual journalists will be using the privacy-preserving functionality soon, via the <a href="https://digitalwitnesslab.org/">Digital Witness Lab</a>!</p>

    <h3>Choosing the right privacy-enhancing tool for the privacy-enhancing job</h3>
    <p>We have finally started to see some adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies like MPC, differential privacy,
    and homomorphic encryption at scale.  But the deployment of these technologies does not always mean that the privacy
    problem is solved.  What privacy gaps remain?  How do we see these systems developing into the future?</p>

    <h3>Formalization of legal copyright notions</h3>
    <p>I have one minor <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01230">contribution</a> in the space of understanding U.S. 
    Copyright's notion of "substantial similarity" a little better.</p>

    
    <br><br>
    <h2>Older Projects</h2>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Improving Sublinear Zero Knowledge Proofs for Boolean Circuits without Assumptions</h3>
    <p>By combining existing ZK proof techniques with additional ``tests'' for checking the soundness of additional
    relations, we create a new ZK proof system for Boolean circuits or circuits in GF(2^k) that achieves a Ligero-style
    proof that is smaller than others in the same category of proofs that do not rely on the discrete log assumption
    and that do not have prohibitive prover or verifier runtime.</p>


    <br><br>
    <h3>Protecting Cryptography from Self-Incrimination</h3>
    <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/862">paper</a></p>
    <p>Technical analysis of the current state of affairs as to whether various cryptographic objects can be compelled
    in a government subpoena as a "foregone conclusion" exception to the U.S. 5th Amendment right against
    self-incrimination.</p>


    <h3>Resilient Password-Based Key Derivation Functions</h3>
    <p><a href="diskcrypt/draft-2018-bog.pdf">paper</a> /
    <a href="diskcrypt/poster.pdf">poster</a></p>
    <p>Older password-based key derivation functions like PBKDF2 rely on
    repeated iteration of a single hash function to force the attacker to spend
    more resources.  But thanks to Bitcoin, the cost of specialized hardware to
    do small, repeated functions, has gone down dramatically.  Newer PBKDFs
    like scrypt add memory as a resource that attackers must spend in order to
    compute efficiently.  We extend this resource consumption model to a PBKDF
    that consumes many resources, like CPU, storage, cache, or chip access in
    order to correctly derive the key from the password.
    Paper is forthcoming.</p>


    <br><br>
    <h3>Privacy Against Inference-Based Device Fingerprinting</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07965">paper</a></p>
    <p>Device fingerpinting methods are employed by websites in order to identify unique devices.  The older,
    "traditional" device fingerprinting methods involve direct requests for information from a client's machine:
    measuring information in the HTTP request header, sending a cookie, or embedding additional web requests (e.g. for
    invisible pixels).  All this information can be identified and blocked from being sent, in order to preserve user
    privacy.  However, the newer wave of device fingerprinting methods use indirect approaches, by asking the user to
    perform a seemingly irrelevant computation and then gleaning information from the result.  These methods are more
    insidious, more difficult to block, and somewhat sneaky in the sense that even an expert client may not be able to
    tell that it's happening.  These methods are only described in general terms in privacy policies.  More research is
    necessary to determine how to address these methods in a way that respects consumer privacy.

    <h3>Proposing Safeguards for Government Risk-Assessment Systems</h3>
    <p><a href="2018/Scheffler_Attaluri-Risk_Assessment_Safeguards.pdf">paper</a></p>
    <p>
    This paper analyzes governmentally-regulated risk assessment systems by evaluating
    them on three axes: We examine the costs of the systems on individuals, the system holders, and
    society, we analyze the inputs to the system, and we describe the transparency (or lack thereof)
    within the systems. Using three case studies—the Unified Passenger system (UPAX), the
    COMPAS Risk & Need Assessment System, and the FICO score—we develop a standardized set
    of potential technical requirements to mitigate abuse and ensure individuals are treated fairly
    while remaining within the constraints levied by the system’s purpose.</p>

    <h3>Dismantling the False Distinction between Traditional Programming and
        Machine Learning in Lethal Autonomous Weapons</h3>
    <p><a href="2019/Autonomous_Weapons_False_Assumptions.pdf">paper</a> /
    <a href="2019/CSLaw_AWS_poster.pdf">poster</a></p>
    <p>Contrary to my expectations at the start of the project, the type of
    programming used to create lethal autonomous weapons does not inherently
    affect their ability to comply with International Humanitarian Law.
    Traditional programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are
    distinct, overlapping techniques in programming autonomous weapons, and the
    use of one technique over another should not affect the standard used to
    determine whether a given lethal autonomous weapon complies with the Law of
    Armed Conflict.  Rather, the same (strict) standards should apply to all
    lethal autonomous weapons, and their outward performance in accordance with
    the law should be the sole determinant of legality.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>From Soft Classifiers to Hard Decisions: How Fair Can We Be?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02003">paper</a> /
    <a href="2019/Poster__Post_Processing_Calibrated_Classifiers(2).pdf">poster</a></p>
    <p>Question: When your machine learning algorithm is "calibrated" for different
    protected groups, can this calibrated score be post-processed in a "fair"
    way?  Answer: In general, no.  But you can achieve some partial fairness
    properties (such as equalizing the positive predictive value across
    groups), or you can <i>defer</i> on some inputs and guarantee good
    expected fairness properties for the non-deferred outputs.  Paper and
    poster forthcoming.</p>

    <h3>The Unintended Consequences of Email Spam Prevention</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319764801">paper</a> /
    <a href="https://emaildns.net/">website</a> / 
    <a href="2018/pamtalk_v7_1.pptx">talk</a> / 
    <a href="https://emaildns.net/poster.pdf">poster</a></p>
    <p>To combat DNS cache poisoning attacks and exploitation of the DNS as an
    amplifier in DoS attacks, many recursive DNS resolvers are configured as
    "closed" and refuse to answer queries made by hosts outside their
    organization.  This work presents a technique to induce DNS queries within
    an organization, using the organization's email service and the Sender
    Policy Framework (SPF) email spam-checking mechanism.  We use this
    technique to study closed resolvers, verifying that most closed DNS resolvers have
    deployed common DNS poisoning defense techniques, but showing that SPF is
    often deployed in a way that allows an external attacker to cause the
    organization's resolver to issue numerous DNS queries to a victim IP
    address by sending a single email to any address within the organization's
    domain.</p>

    <h3>Proactively-secure Accumulo with Cryptographic Enforcement</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/mit-ll/PACE-python">code</a></p>
    <p>At the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, as assistant research staff, I worked in the Secure and Resilient Systems and
    Technology group within the Cybersecurity and Information Sciences division to assist in the implementation,
    testing, and release of a library that adds confidentiality and integrity guarantees to the Accumulo database,
    protecting it against a malicious server or sysadmin.  Earlier in the project, I also implemented Oblivious RAM
    (Path ORAM) for Accumulo.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Quantifying Latent Fingerprint Quality</h3>
    <p><a href="2015/Final_Presentation_For_MITRE.pdf">talk</a></p>
    <p>As a capstone project at Harvey Mudd College, I worked with a team of four students for the MITRE Corporation on a project to design, implement, and test a system that uses image processing and machine learning techniques to evaluate the suitability of crime scene fingerprint images for identification by Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Statistical Testing of Cryptographic Entropy Sources</h3>
    <p><a href="2014/scheffler_entropy.pdf">talk</a></p>
    <p>As a summer undergraduate research fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), I worked with Dr. Allen Roginsky in the Computer Security Division to improve NIST's statistical tests for entropy sources for use in cryptographic random number generators.  I also made adjustments to the process for generating large primes used in cryptography.</p>
