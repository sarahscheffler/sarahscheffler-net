    <h2>Are you interested in working with me?</h2>
    <p>If you are thinking about applying to work on your Ph.D. with me: Please apply to either CMU's <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/prospective/doctoral-studies/doctoral-application/index.html">Engineering and Public Policy
        Ph.D. Program</a> (in the College of Engineering)
    or the <a href="https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/prospective-students/apply.html">Societal Computing Ph.D. program</a> (in the School of Computer Science).
    The deadlines are typically in early-mid December.
    I usually reach out to students I am interested in interviewing to work with me in the early spring; I will probably not respond to any cold-emails you send me.
    </p>
    <p>If you are a master's student or undergraduate already at CMU and are interested in conducting research with me, please send me an email with (1) your CV/resume, (2) your favorite privacy/security experience (a class you
    took, a project you did, etc.),  (3) your major/year/program, (4) what your goals are in pursuing research (exploring? preparing to apply to further research positions? working on a master's thesis?), and (5) your approximate ideal workload (hours/week).
    I have found it helpful to do a "trial run" of research on the timescale of 4-8 weeks (similar to a class project) before we decide if you want to do research with me longer term.  I can typically support undergraduates
    working for credit (a course) during the semester, and go through existing funded undergraduate research programs (e.g. REUSE) during the summer.  It is very rare that I am able to fund undergraduate researchers long-term
    during the semester, but it does happen from time to time.</p>

    <h2>Have a privacy anecdote to share?</h2>
    <p>Every year I collect "privacy anecdotes" to share in a short talk at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh for 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day">Data Privacy Day</a> in January!  
    These are little short stories of things you think about, do, etc. that are privacy-relevant.
    I select some of the submitted anecdotes to read publicly at the event (credited or anonymously).
    If you want to submit one or more anecdotes, please submit them here:
    <a href="privacy-anecdotes-2025">https://sarahscheffler.net/privacy-anecdotes-2025</a>.</p>

    <!--<h2>Seeking Ph.D. students to apply Dec 2024</h2>
    <p><b>I am seeking Ph.D. student applicants for the next academic year (applications due December 11, 2024)</b>
    I am especially seeking students who are interested in working on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content moderation in encrypted environments</li>
        <li>Cryptographic verification (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs)</li>
        <li>Privacy and data confidentiality in robotic applications</li>
        <li>The intersection of (mostly U.S.) law with specific parts of cryptography/privacy (especially self-incrimination, surveillance, and sometimes copyright)</li>
        <li>Finding the "right" setting of privacy in cryptographic privacy-preserving applications (e.g. when is it okay to link a record?)</li>
        <li>Anyone with interest/background in cryptography or privacy who is interested in applied work that is relevant to policy, regulation, law, or general society</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of those sounds like your jam, please apply to the Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. programs in either the 
    <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/prospective/doctoral-studies/doctoral-application/index.html">Engineering and Public Policy Ph.D. Program</a> 
    (in the College of Engineering)
    or the <a href="https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/prospective-students/apply.html">Societal Computing Ph.D. program</a> (in the School of Computer Science).</p>

    <p>Please submit your application and write my name somewhere in it; I have very limited bandwidth to respond to prospective student emails.  I typically interview interested students in the early spring..</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">CyLab</a>, Carnegie Mellon University's Security and Privacy Institute, studying at the intersection of cryptography and policy.
    I am jointly appointed between <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">Software and Societal Systems</a> (in the School of Computer Science) and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/">Engineering and Public Policy</a> (in the
    College of Engineering).  If you are interested in joining me as a student in the Fall of 2024, please first poke around this page to see what kind of work I do, 
    and apply to either department at CMU.  (I can sometimes advise students outside of S3D or EPP; if you applied to a different department, please email me.)
    My ideal student has a strong background or interest in cryptography and its intersection with societal, legal, and policy issues.</p>

    <p>I am a studying applied cryptographer working at the intersection of cryptography, privacy, policy, and law.  My
    interdisciplinary work includes policy and technical analysis of end-to-end encrypted content moderation, compelled
    decryption, and privacy-preserving computation as applied to journalism, age verification, and more.  
    I also do "pure" applied cryptography, including work
    on zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, private set intersection, and hash combiners.</p>

    <p>Formerly, I was a postdoctoral research associate at MIT's <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/">Internet Policy Research Initiative</a>,
    and before that I was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University's <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>.
    I obtained my Ph.D. from Boston University in 2021, advised by Prof. Mayank Varia.  
    During my time at BU, I was a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/busec/">BUsec</a> 
    group, I organized the  
    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/riscs/seminars-large-and-small-covering-the-security-issues-of-today/">BUsec
        Seminar</a> for security, cryptography, and privacy, as well as the Multi-Party Computation Reading Group, 
    and I was an active member of the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/hic/cyber-alliance/">Cyber Security, Law, and Society Alliance</a>.</p>
